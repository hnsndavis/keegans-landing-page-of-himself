            <article class="blog-content">
                <p>I didn't send a newsletter last week. Not because I didn't have anything to say, but because I was in the middle of living it instead of writing about it.</p>
                
                <p>Let me recap it for you: We found a tenant for our apartment lease on a Saturday morning and moved out by Tuesday night, I accepted a job offer that same day and my mentor sent me a podcast that completely reshaped how I'm thinking about building Web Launch Lab. It's been quite a week…</p>
                
                <p>So I'm back, and showing up with the behind the scenes look at what's been unfolding.</p>
                
                <h2>The Week That Got Away</h2>
                
                <p>Moving into our friends basement as an adult with a baby was definitely not the plan. It wasn't even something I ever pictured… But it's turning out to be one of the best decisions we've made. Our kids are constantly playing together, our dinners are loud, there's twice the mess, and twice the help. It's the community I didn't realize we were missing.</p>
                
                <p>An equally as exciting surprise came last week when I was praying about what my next professional move would be. A company came to mind immediately. They had offered me a job last August but I had turned it down to accept my previous one. I saw they had an opening for the position I could've accepted, so I recorded a simple video message reintroducing myself and requesting a consideration. Days later I spoke with the manager and was re-offered the job! No application, no lengthy interview process.</p>
                
                <p><strong>It's the only job I applied for since getting let go.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Isn't God good? For anyone who knows my story or followed my previous newsletter, you'll remember I spent time in vocational ministry while being fascinated by the tech world, before transitioning into the marketplace. That's why this new position as a Ministry Consultant is the perfect intersection of both of these worlds.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Everything I've been through the last 5 years has led to this moment.</strong></p>
                
                <h2>The Video That Changed Everything</h2>
                
                <p>I start my new role toward the middle of September, leaving me a great amount of time to really solidify the launch of Web Launch Lab. I was preparing for the work week as my mentor sent me a message, watch this video, do what it says, and we'll meet in two weeks.</p>
                
                <p>I was literally watching that same video as he messaged me.</p>
                
                <p>Talk about more providential timing! I was already implementing the exact framework from the video. It's about building offers that solve real problems people care about, structuring them to create genuine value, and pricing based on transformation rather than time.</p>
                
                <p>This isn't just another business strategy video. It's the missing piece I've been looking for when it comes to structuring the business.</p>
                
                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                
                <p>I'm really looking forward to what's ahead. The skills gained in my upcoming job will help me scale my business, and the flexibility it offers will serve this venture well.</p>
                
                <p>Life moved faster than my newsletter schedule last week, but I'm still committed to showing up weekly and sharing what's happening in real time. Some weeks might be about faith and transitions; some weeks might dive deeper into business strategy or building something from scratch.</p>
                
                <p>Thanks for sticking around through the chaos. Even when I miss a week, the journey continues… <strong>The mess continues to be the point.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Thanks for following along through this transition. The messy middle continues to teach me that God's timing is often different than our planning, but always better.</p>
