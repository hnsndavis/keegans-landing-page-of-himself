                <p><em>Why the most important work happens in the space between shortcuts</em></p>
                
                <p>I thought AI would give me my life back. Instead, it just gave my boss more reasons to fill my calendar.</p>
                
                <p>AI makes me faster at work, sure. But here's what actually happens: my employer notices I'm more productive, so they just require more output. My value hasn't changed. My income hasn't changed. I'm just doing more work in the same eight hours.</p>
                
                <p>This is the age-old reason people get tired of working for pharaoh.</p>
                
                <p>Last week, I heard Simon Sinek talk about web design agencies using AI to work faster, but keeping their prices the same. They're pocketing the efficiency gains instead of passing them on. Smart business move, maybe. But it got me thinking about something deeper.</p>
                
                <h2>The Efficiency Trap</h2>
                
                <p>The real commodity here isn't productivity. It's time. And I can't get it back.</p>
                
                <p>But Simon's deeper point stuck with me. <strong>Efficiency isn't inherently valuable. What's valuable happens in the struggle.</strong> The problem-solving. The creativity. The resilience we build when things don't come easy.</p>
                
                <p>This got me wondering: if we're obsessed with productivity systems at work, what about the rest of our lives?</p>
                
                <p>Someone recently told me we treat friendships like hobbies instead of relationships that require maintenance and intentionality. That hit hard.</p>
                
                <p>We pour accountability systems into work. Deadlines. Sprints. Meetings. But who's holding us accountable to deepening our friendships? To repairing them when they break? To simply maintaining them at all?</p>
                
                <h2>The Space Between</h2>
                
                <p>Maybe the messy middle isn't something to be optimized away.</p>
                
                <p>The awkward conversations. The inefficient coffee dates. The slow work of showing up consistently. The uncertainty of not knowing exactly where your career is headed. The discomfort of outgrowing old friendships while building new ones.</p>
                
                <p>Maybe that's where real growth happens.</p>
                
                <p>I used to think I would have it figured out by now. If I'm honest, most days I am still waiting for that day. But what if the waiting is the point? What if the figuring-out process is more valuable than the having-figured-out destination?</p>
                
                <h2>The Gloriously Inefficient</h2>
                
                <p>What if robots handle the routine stuff so we can focus on the messy, inefficient, gloriously human work of actually connecting?</p>
                
                <p>Agencies can offer high-value work at premium prices because they're reinforcing systems that work for them. But what if we built something that worked for us? What if we stopped optimizing our humanity away?</p>
                
                <p>The messy middle is that space between starting and arriving. Between dreaming and achieving. Between who you were and who you're becoming.</p>
                
                <p>It's uncomfortable. It's uncertain. It's inefficient.</p>
                
                <p>It's also where everything important happens.</p>
                
                <h2>Welcome to the Mess</h2>
                
                <p>Over the next several weeks, I want to explore this space together. The transitions that don't fit neatly into LinkedIn updates. The struggles that productivity hacks can't solve. The growth that only happens when we stop trying to skip the process.</p>
                
                <p>Because maybe the mess isn't the problem. Maybe the mess is the point.</p>
                
                <p><strong>I'm curious:</strong> What struggles in your life might be worth preserving? What "inefficiencies" are you most grateful for?</p>
                
                <p>Let's learn together in this messy middle. No shortcuts needed.</p>
