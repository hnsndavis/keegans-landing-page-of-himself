                <p><em>What I learned when "What should I do?" got the same answer every time</em></p>
                
                <p>I used to think prayer was supposed to work like GPS: ask God where to go, get turn-by-turn directions, then arrive promptly to your destination.</p>
                
                <p>For years, I wrestled with God in prayer over my vocation. Was it a job? A role? A purpose? I kept asking, <strong>"What should I do?"</strong> And for years, I got the same response that felt more like a riddle than an answer.</p>
                
                <p><em>"I will bless what you put your hands to."</em></p>
                
                <p>That should feel exciting, right? God is telling you He'll bless whatever you decide? Not for me. I just wanted to be doing the right thing. I wanted the undeniable calling Moses got from a burning bush. I wanted a voice from Heaven to tell me to take a U-turn, or even let me select if I wanted the scenic route or the fastest route.</p>
                
                <p>Instead, I felt as though I received a divine shoulder shrug. I knew God wasn't indifferent and that He really cared… So why wouldn't He just tell me what to do?</p>
                
                <h2>The Wrestling</h2>
                
                <p>I wondered if I wasn't praying hard enough or not praying the right way. I would oscillate between fervent, intense prayer sessions and lackadaisical casual prayers (I called it "trust" but I was low key being lazy) to see what would move God the most.</p>
                
                <p>I felt like I was playing spiritual charades with God.</p>
                
                <p>Meanwhile, I kept hearing conflicting ideas about work from other Christians. I picked up on a lot of sharp distinctions between work and purpose. One of them was the belief that work is just work and God doesn't really care as much as we think about our jobs. This didn't ever resonate with me. There had to be more to work than work, right?</p>
                
                <p>The lack of clarity made every role change, job change, and vocational decision feel like I was fumbling in the dark, desperately hoping I'd miraculously end up in the right place. Meanwhile, I was still getting the same cryptic response:</p>
                
                <p><em>"I'll bless what you put your hands to."</em></p>
                
                <h2>Fresh Insight</h2>
                
                <p>A few days ago, my wife and I decided that when we're bored at home, we'd open up the Bible and talk through it. I was shooting on my son's Little Tikes hoop as she read out of Psalm 32:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you. Be not like a horse or a mule, without understanding, which must be curbed with bit and bridle, or it will not stay near you."</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>The analogy God uses struck us. God is saying He doesn't want to control us with bit and bridle like animals without understanding. He doesn't want to use force or coercion to move us. He wants to counsel us, and He wants us to understand and respond.</p>
                
                <p><strong>I realized my approach to prayer was making a donkey out of me.</strong> I wanted God to lead me around by the nose instead of growing in understanding and wisdom. I was taking the easy road, desiring God to make all of my choices because the reality is, it's a more tedious thing to let yourself be equipped to make the wise, right decisions.</p>
                
                <h2>The Counselor's Way</h2>
                
                <p>Think about it: counselors don't typically tell you exactly what to do (at least in my experience). They help you discover what you already know deep down and guide you toward your own conclusions.</p>
                
                <p>When I counsel others, I don't usually say, "Here's what you should do." Instead, I ask leading questions that help them think through their situation. I point out patterns they might not see. I help them connect their values to their choices.</p>
                
                <p>Oftentimes, this is how God counsels us too. With His loving eye on us, rather than providing GPS coordinates. I'm grateful for this, because I'd honestly rather have someone in the car present with me through traffic than to hear and follow commands by myself.</p>
                
                <h2>The Question That Changed Everything</h2>
                
                <p>Now I understand why "I'll bless what you put your hands to" used to frustrate me so much. <strong>I was asking the wrong question.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Instead of "What should I do?" I'm learning to ask <strong>"What do I need to know? What understanding do I need to gain?"</strong></p>
                
                <p>This shift is slowly changing everything. Instead of waiting for divine direction from outside, I'm learning to develop divine wisdom from within. For example, I'm building Web Launch Lab right now without theophanic dreams or an angelic announcement. But I'm also not stumbling in the dark. I'm asking better questions, seeking understanding, and trusting that God's hand is on what I'm putting my hands to.</p>
                
                <h2>The Silent Counsel</h2>
                
                <p>God's "silence" is never absence. Sometimes it's trust. Through His consistent counsel, could we already be equipped for more than we realize? After all, He doesn't want to puppeteer us. He wants to partner with us.</p>
                
                <p>Here's what I'm reminding myself of today: <strong>The messy middle of vocational uncertainty isn't punishment, but a training ground.</strong> It's where we develop the muscles of discernment, stretch our faith, and grow in real wisdom.</p>
                
                <p><strong>I'm curious:</strong> What questions are you asking God in this season? Do you need Him to make the decision for you, or do you just need to gain more understanding?</p>
                
                <p>Let's keep learning together in this beautifully uncertain space where faith meets responsibility, and trust calls us to action.</p>
                
                <p>Because the mess was never the problem. The mess has been the point.</p>
