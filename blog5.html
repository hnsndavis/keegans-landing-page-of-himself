                <p><em>What happens when God moves before you even know you need Him to</em></p>
                
                <p>I walked into a Monday morning meeting that randomly appeared on my work calendar. Ten minutes later, I was unemployed and clearing out my desk.</p>
                
                <p>The funny thing is, I'd already been sensing that something was shifting. Just the day before my wife and I had multiple people walking up to us and offering prophetic prayers. All of them had to do with a time of transition being ahead and how we needed to trust God…</p>
                
                <p>So when I lost my job, my first instinct wasn't to panic. It was to say what I've found myself saying a lot the last few years, <strong>"Alright, God. I don't understand this, but I'm trusting You."</strong></p>
                
                <h2>The Setup - Months Ago</h2>
                
                <p>I started considering a job change a few months ago. I'll keep it simple for you: I wasn't making enough money to support my family - our current credit card debt will prove it. I knew what I was bringing home, recently found out when my next pay increase opportunity would be, and based on the company's promotion structure, I'd still be underpaid for the work I was doing.</p>
                
                <p>At this time, tensions at work had started to rise. Without needing to defend my position or say anything negative about the company, the relationship was simply fizzling out and wasn't working for either of us.</p>
                
                <p>With this in mind, we were considering major life changes and having a ton of "what if" brainstorming sessions at home. What if I get a second job? What if WebLaunchLab takes off and is our primary income? What if we found somewhere to live that was hundreds less in monthly rent? That cut one dream session short for my wife. Her immediate response was, <em>"That cheap in our city? I'll need to borrow your faith on that one."</em></p>
                
                <h2>Sunday's Prep</h2>
                
                <p>I was moved deeply by the Holy Spirit on Sunday, but in a way I didn't understand at the moment. I just knew God was overwhelming me with His love, showing me how near He was. But it came with a sense of loss/grief as well.</p>
                
                <p>At the same time, my wife received prayer to be a source of strength for me as we were about to undergo a big transition, but was offered reassurance that God wouldn't leave us hanging.</p>
                
                <p>Another person told us that God knew our desire to be in the right place and that He would honor that as we wait - we only needed to trust Him. My wife probably was hoping that "place" and reward was an all-inclusive resort in Mexico, so it's unfortunate what happened with my job. But what happened later Sunday evening ended up being really cool.</p>
                
                <p>That night we had our close friends over. While the dads were cleaning up the dinner mess, I was sharing about needing clarity on what to do - or where to go - next. He offered something kind of shocking, <strong>"Why don't you guys move in with us?"</strong> After all, they had just purchased a new home and had the space; he figured it could be fun.</p>
                
                <p>We pitched it to our wives and without much deliberation, we all felt quickly this could be a good thing… The ladies and the babies are best friends. It would be a sweet season of life… And we'd save $650 less on rent than we (I) were even believing for.</p>
                
                <p>We said we'd pray and let them know.</p>
                
                <h2>Monday's Reality</h2>
                
                <p>Right after I got let go, my wife said two things, one that humored me and one that surprised me:</p>
                
                <p><em>"Well I guess we have to move in with them now, huh?"</em> And, <em>"Let's just enjoy the rest of this day. Let's not worry about anything OR try to depend on our own ingenuity. You have a history of trying to 'just figure it out.' Anxiety and innovation don't really mix well."</em></p>
                
                <p>No panic mode. No problem solving. No scramble to update my resume. No scouring job boards, preparing spreadsheets, or frantically refreshing Zillow. Just a day-long pause for prayer and gratitude.</p>
                
                <h2>The Beautiful Mess Unfolds</h2>
                
                <p>When we woke up the next morning without a plan of action, I was reminded of my newsletter from last week and we decided to pray accordingly. <em>"God, what do you want us to know? About You, ourselves, and people?"</em> I immediately felt faith rising… <strong>"God, send the people to me."</strong></p>
                
                <p>I lost my wife on that one for a moment since I didn't pray to be sent to someone but for someone to come to me.</p>
                
                <p>But the wonderful part is that, for the rest of the week, I received inquiry after inquiry from random, God-sent people around our city. I would show up at a coffee shop I felt led to and watch as people approached me, either hearing via word of mouth about my work or having seen the way I've been showing up online. I also got multiple red hot leads online!</p>
                
                <p>It became quite clear that God was moving on this business launch…</p>
                
                <p>I'm energized by what I'm building in a way I haven't been in months. I'm continuing to ask what else I need to know (there's so much I don't). Most importantly, I had one of the most socially fulfilling weeks than I've had in months. My love for people and connecting to them was fanned into flame again.</p>
                
                <h2>The Majestic Part</h2>
                
                <p>Here's what I'm considering: Maybe this is what God saying "I'll bless what you put your hands to" looks like in action?</p>
                
                <p>Not a divine GPS system giving me turn-by-turn directions, but God preparing things I couldn't see while equipping me for decisions I didn't know I'd need to make:</p>
                
                <p><strong>The housing solution came before the housing problem.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The prayer for strength came before we knew we'd need strength.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The business momentum came right as the day-job disappeared.</strong></p>
                
                <p>I'm encouraged as I write this. God wasn't waiting for me to figure it out. He was already figuring it out!</p>
                
                <p>Is the middle much messier than I would've wanted? Yes. Our financial situation is uncertain. We're moving into our friends basement. I'm building another business without the safety net of steady income. But it's also incredibly beautiful. And wonderful. And somehow, majestic. Because in all the chaos and uncertainty, I can see God's hand. He's not "controlling" every detail, but He's definitely present in every moment. At the end of the day, I'd rather have God walking through the mess with us than Him distantly removing the mess…</p>
                
                <p><strong>The mess isn't the problem. The mess is where God shows up.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Enough about my mess… I'm curious:</p>
                
                <p><strong>What "mess" in your life might actually be God preparing something you can't see yet? Where are you being invited to trust instead of scramble?</strong></p>
                
                <p>Let's keep learning together in this beautifully uncertain space where faith meets the unknown and trust calls us forward.</p>
                
                <p>Because the mess was never the problem. The mess has been the point.</p>
