                <h2>Hey friend,</h2>
                
                <p>This is the first edition of Notes from Keegan. If you're reading this, you're at the absolute beginning of a new habit for both of us showing up, sharing process, and building in public.</p>
                
                <h3>Why this, why now</h3>
                
                <p>For most of my life, I tried to build things alone. I convinced myself that if I hustled hard enough in silence, eventually, success would find its way into my life. Instead, I stacked up half-started projects, a few quiet failures, and endless ideas that never quite made it out of hiding.</p>
                
                <p>A little over a year ago, I found myself jobless and doubting with a new baby, a sense of total uncertainty, and the subconscious idea that I could figure it our alone conclusion, I couldn't. I learned the hard way: isolation kills momentum. We're simply not meant to build alone.</p>
                
                <h3>Lesson / Encouragement</h3>
                
                <p>What's changed for me lately? It's simple, but not easy: <strong>start before you're ready</strong>. Perfectionism and Excellence are not the same thing. All work works, It either works for you or it works on you, I've done a lot of the later. Clarity comes from action.</p>
                
                <h3>What I'm Building</h3>
                
                <p>This week I am launch Web Launch Lab my venture to give away a free custom website every single week, AND my commitment to show up publicly and bring others into the process. It's both terrifying and energizing, and after years of almost-launches, actually hitting "publish" feels like a victory in itself.</p>
                
                <h3>Question for You</h3>
                
                <p>What's one thing you've been waiting to start until it's "perfect"? What's held you back from sharing your journey or launching your idea?</p>
                
                <p>Reply and let me know. I read every note, you're not building alone anymore.</p>
                
                <p>Here's to doing the thing together.</p>
